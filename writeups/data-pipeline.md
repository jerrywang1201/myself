# Compliance Data Pipeline for 4M+ Records

*Software Development Engineer Intern — KPMG*  
*June 2021 – Aug 2021*

## Summary
This work felt like a different kind of engineering: no boards, no signals, just data and reliability. I built a Python + MySQL data pipeline to process 4M+ automotive compliance records and integrate statistical analysis into internal approval workflows. The challenge was turning a slow, fragile process into something predictable.

## What I Worked On
- Created an end-to-end processing pipeline using Python (Pandas) and MySQL.
- Integrated statistical analysis models (regression, outlier detection) using Statsmodels and NumPy.
- Optimized processing to reduce end-to-end time by 30%.

## Personal Notes
I learned how to think about performance as a system problem. The biggest gains didn’t come from clever algorithms but from tightening the workflow and removing unnecessary steps. I also learned how important it is to keep analysis transparent so that non-technical reviewers can trust the results.

Even though it was “just data,” the mindset felt similar to firmware: define the constraints, make the flow deterministic, and make sure every output can be explained.

## Outcomes
- Improved reporting accuracy and reduced manual review effort.
- Faster analysis cycles for compliance decisions.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, MySQL, Statsmodels, NumPy.
