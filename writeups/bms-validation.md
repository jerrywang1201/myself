# BMS Validation Automation and Signal Integrity

*System Design Engineer Intern — Apple*  
*Apr 2022 – Sept 2022*

## Summary
This project was about making hardware tests feel less like manual rituals and more like repeatable science. I designed and automated BMS validation workflows by combining Python data collection with hardware test setups. The focus was precision measurement and signal integrity so that pass/fail results actually meant something.

## What I Worked On
- Automated BMS validation with Python-based data collection.
- Built precision measurement logic for voltage and current sensing.
- Diagnosed analog signal integrity issues.
- Verified SPI/I2C/GPIO interfaces using oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.

## Personal Notes
I learned that measurement is a system, not a single number. If the signal path is noisy or the timing is off, the data is meaningless. I spent a lot of time chasing small analog issues that looked like software bugs. The process forced me to become more careful and more methodical.

It was also my first taste of how automation changes behavior: once a workflow was repeatable, people trusted it more and tested more often. That feedback loop made the system and the team better.

## Outcomes
- Reduced manual test cycles and improved validation efficiency by 14%.
- Improved reliability of hardware–software interaction across revisions.

## Tools
Python, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, SPI, I2C, GPIO.
